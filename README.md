# 🛒 E-commerce Sales Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

> **End-to-End Data Analytics Project | SQL • Python • Power BI**

🚀 An industry-style analytics project showcasing how raw e-commerce data is transformed into **actionable business insights** through database querying, Python analysis, and interactive dashboards.

## 📌 Project Overview

✨ This project simulates a **real-world data analyst workflow** used in startups and product-driven companies. Data is pulled directly from a SQL database into Python, analyzed for trends and KPIs, and finally visualized in an executive-ready Power BI dashboard.

🔍 The dashboard enables quick answers to questions like:

* How are sales and profits performing YTD?
* Which products drive the most and least revenue?
* Which regions and segments contribute the most?
* How does shipping type impact sales distribution?

This project presents an **end-to-end E-commerce Sales Analysis** using **SQL, Python, and Power BI**. The goal of the project is to analyze sales performance, identify business trends, and build an interactive dashboard to support **data-driven decision-making**.

The project demonstrates the complete analytics workflow — from raw data extraction and cleaning to exploratory analysis and executive-level dashboarding — similar to real-world business and product analytics tasks.

## 🔍 Data Analysis Workflow

### 🔗 Python–SQL Connectivity (Real-World Setup)

* Connected **Python to MySQL database** using database connectors
* Executed SQL queries directly inside Python scripts
* Automated data extraction into **Pandas DataFrames**
* Reduced manual effort and ensured data accuracy

🔁 *This mirrors how analysts work with live databases in production environments.*

### 1️⃣ Data Extraction & Transformation

* Retrieved raw transactional data using **joins, filters, and aggregations**
* Calculated KPIs such as:

  * YTD Sales, Profit, Quantity
  * Category, Product, and Region metrics
  * Shipping-type contribution

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

* Cleaned and validated datasets
* Performed trend, distribution, and comparative analysis
* Identified outliers and low-performing products

### 3️⃣ Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)

* Designed a **dark-themed executive dashboard**
* Implemented:

  * KPI Cards with YoY indicators
  * Dynamic filters (Segment, Region)
  * Top & Bottom product analysis
  * Geo-maps and donut charts

### 🔗 Python–SQL Connectivity

* Established a direct connection between **Python and MySQL** using appropriate database connectors
* Executed **SQL queries within Python** to fetch transactional sales data
* Automated data extraction into Pandas DataFrames for further cleaning and analysis
* Ensured data consistency between database outputs and analytical datasets

This approach simulates a **real-world analytics setup**, where analysts pull live data from databases into Python for analysis and reporting.

### 1️⃣ Data Extraction (SQL via Python)

* Connected Python to a **MySQL database** to retrieve raw e-commerce sales data

* Executed **joins, filters, aggregations, and GROUP BY queries** directly from Python

* Calculated key metrics such as:

  * YTD Sales, Profit, and Quantity
  * Category- and product-level KPIs
  * Region- and shipping-type performance

* Retrieved transactional sales data using **SQL queries**

* Used **joins, filters, aggregations, and GROUP BY** to calculate:

  * YTD Sales & Profit
  * Quantity sold
  * Category and product-level KPIs
  * Region and shipping-type performance

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)

* Cleaned and transformed data using **Pandas**
* Handled missing values and data inconsistencies
* Performed **EDA** to uncover:

  * Sales and profit trends
  * Category-wise performance
  * High and low revenue products
  * Regional sales patterns

### 3️⃣ Dashboard Development (Power BI)

* Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with:

  * KPI cards (Sales, Profit, Quantity, Profit Margin)
  * Category-wise and product-wise performance tables
  * Top & Bottom 5 products by YTD sales
  * Region-wise and shipping-type sales distribution
  * Segment filters (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)

---

## 📊 Key Insights
